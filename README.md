# BookletBuilder

BookletBuilder is a [Java](https://java.com) Package for building booklets. It
can be run as a standalone application or as a library in other tools.

## Supported Conversions

At the moment, the tool only supports a duplex, 4-up imposition where the
pages are cut, stacked and folded:

## Usage

BookletBuilder is a Java application, so you need to
[have Java installed](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml)
before using it.

The distribution JAR file should include all of its prerequisites and not
require any further libraries or downloads.

### Standalone Application

#### Graphical User Interface

The application provides a _very_ simple graphical interface. Double-clicking
on the JAR file should bring up an open-file dialog box to select your PDF
file for conversion. This will be followed by a Save dialog to save the
resulting booklet file.

#### Command-Line

On the command-line, you can pass an optional argument that will disable
inclusion of printing instructions on the first two pages:

```
% java -jar [path/to/jar/]BookletBuilder-all.jar [--skipInstructions] <in_file> <out_file>
```

If the <in_file> and/or the <out_file> are not provided, the GUI interface
will be used to prompt for the missing information.

### In Java Code

The library tries to abstract as much away for users as possible. The minimum
code required to create a booklet from another PDF would be:

```java
package com.stealthymonkeys.pdf.example;

import java.io.IOException;

import com.stealthymonkeys.pdf.FourUpBookletStrategy;

public class BookletBuilderExample {
  // Usage: java com.stealthymonkeys.pdf.example.BookletBuilderExample <in_file> <out_file>
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    FourUpBookletStrategy strategy = new FourUpBookletStrategy(args[0], args[1]);
    strategy.impose();
  }
}
```

You might also check out [BookletBuilder.java](https://github.com/erikogan/BookletBuilder/blob/master/src/main/java/com/stealthymonkeys/pdf/BookletBuilder.java)
for a slightly more complex example.

Once there are multiple imposition Strategies we will also include an Abstract
Factory to facilitate users selecting the right Strategy for their needs.
